**Course Code** : CSE 226(V3)

**Course Title** : Algorithm Design And Analysis Laboratory

**Course Teacher** : Syed Md. Minhaz Hossain

**Session** : Spring 2020

**Course Description** : Algorithms are recipes for solving computational problems. In this course student will study fundamental algorithms for solving a variety of problems, including sorting, searching and graph algorithms. More importantly, the focus will be on general design and analysis techniques that underlie these algorithms. For example, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greediness, and probabilistic approaches will be examined.
